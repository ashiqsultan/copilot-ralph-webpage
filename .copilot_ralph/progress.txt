[0] Initiate tailwind for the project
Tailwind CSS has been successfully configured for the project. Installed Tailwind CSS v4 with required dependencies including @tailwindcss/postcss plugin for PostCSS v8 compatibility. Created tailwind.config.js with content paths configured for index.html and all JS/TS/JSX/TSX files in the src directory. Created postcss.config.js with the Tailwind PostCSS plugin. Added Tailwind directives to src/index.css. Updated App.jsx with Tailwind utility classes to verify the setup is working. The build process completes successfully and generates optimized CSS with Tailwind styles.
